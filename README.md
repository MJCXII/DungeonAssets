# DungeonAssets
A Plugin for a Minecraft Server I've developed that coincides with features and other plugins on the server


# Key Finder

The plugin spawns in a randomly generated Key in one of mutiple chests, which allows the player to open a door using the 
BigDoors plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/big-doors.58669/
Once the key has been removed from the chest, a timer starts for 1 hour when another key will spawn in one of the other chests scattered around the area.

# Special Warp
When a player has finished in a dungeon, if he is to right click a specific block with the correct conditions met (this includes right clicking the block with another specific block in his hand)
the player is then warped to another location, with a sound effect played on arrival, and a title screen to congratulate the player on completeing the Dungeon.
